Ever needed to monitor P99 latency across hundreds of servers without breaking the bank? Here's a simple yet effective technique we used at Thinknear to monitor our high-scale distributed system's performance.

## The Challenge

We were processing hundreds of thousands of requests per second across hundreds of auto-scaling servers. Traditional P99 (99th percentile) latency monitoring solutions were either technically inadequate for our scale or prohibitively expensive.

## The Solution

Instead of trying to calculate exact P99 values, we flipped the problem on its head. We simply counted requests that exceeded our P99 latency target. The logic is straightforward: if less than 1% of total requests exceed your P99 target, you're meeting your SLA.
