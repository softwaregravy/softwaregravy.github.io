My name is John Hinnegan. From time to time, I will blog here about management or solving some problems. 

I'm an experienced software engineer, engineering manager, and entrepreneur. I have worked at Amazon and Google as an engineer, manager, and sr. manager. I cofounded [Thinknear](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/telenav-acquires-thinknear--b8205794) which went through the innagural [Techstars NYC](https://www.businessinsider.com/techstars-biggest-exit-yet-thinknear-gets-acquired-for-225-million-2012-10) batch, was [sold to Telenav](ttps://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/telenav-acquires-thinknear--b8205794), and is now part of [InMarket](https://inmarket.com/thinknear/). I recently cofounded [Lumo](https://www.lumo.ag), though I have handed off day-to-day operations.
