## John Hinnegan's Webpage. Always WIP.

You can find me online on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnhinnegan/). 

I'm a software engineer and technology leader. I've been a developer at Amazon.com and a mid-level manager at Amazon.com and Google. I started ThinkNear, going through Techstars, raising money from top VCs, and selling to Telenav after less than 2 years. I'm currently working on my new startup, [Lumo](https://lumo.ag).
